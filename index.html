    <h1>FaB Boost for Images</h1>
    <p>
      A simple and efficient image processing microservice that remote downloads, caches, and manipulates images on the fly. Built with PHP and the League's Glide library, it
      provides a simple URL-based API for image transformations.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use it in conjunction with a function that creates a lovely img tag with srcset ;
      <br />
      It accepts a URL like mydomain.com/my-image.jpg?w=100
      <br />
      Downloads and caches remote images from trusted domains, caching the original image
      <br />
      Performs transformations; resizes, crops, blurs etc., caching the transformed image
      <br />
